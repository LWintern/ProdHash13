    quote: "Being the part of the workshop as a participant as well as Technical Volunteer was an amazing experience. Being a participant in a workshop helped me in learning new concepts and also brushing up my existing skills. Being a technical volunteer helped me in understanding what type of queries can be faced while setting up different tools and while integrating them together, also I helped many participants in solving their technical issues.. I want to thank Vimal Daga sir and LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd for providing me the opportunity. Looking for more such opportunities to learn , grow and help others also in upskilling.",

I walked away feeling so much more confident in my understanding of DSA and its applications. The energy and passion Vimal Sir brings to every session is truly inspiring, and it‚Äôs amazing how he simplifies even the toughest concepts. üí° Thank you, LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd and Vimal Daga Sir, for such an insightful and engaging masterclass! üíªüôè",
