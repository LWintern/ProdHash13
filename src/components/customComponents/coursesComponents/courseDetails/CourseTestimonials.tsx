    content: `Hey Folks,

Learning here at @Linux World is awesome.
Sharing some amazing content I witnessed last week.

1. How to run Website audits using Analytics by @Dhruv Gupta!
Learning about how to conduct audits and the best tools and practices, personally made me super interested in website audits as a career opportunity.
(ps - I wanna know more)

2. Graphic design secrets revealed by @Devdutt Marathkar -
What a creative session this was..!! Devdutt talked to us how he created pathforce technology along with the emojis for Hotstar. It was such a valuable session.

3. The Art of Storytelling by @Suprshsh Puri -
As a fresher, almost everyone talks about having a great portfolio to get a job. Rups broke down the entire process of making one for us so clearly.

4. Growth Hacking workshop by @Vaibhav Sisinty ðŸ”¥-
This was a bonus that dropped in my inbox and was definitely an amazing one. I learned so many new terms, majorly the difference between marketing and growth and Vaibhav's own experience. Absolutely loved the energy.

Grateful to all the mentors here for sharing their wisdom with us. Glad to be a part of #cap.`,

    content: `From Google searches to customized Netflix recommendations, AI has been a part of our daily routines for years. Its ability to quickly analyze vast amounts of data has revolutionized the way we live, enabling us to better target our marketing campaigns and optimize our strategies. However, the effectiveness of AI depends largely on the clarity and precision of our requirements.

Recently, I had the privilege of attending a workshop hosted by @Radhika Chopra and conducted by @Linux World. The session helped me understand how we can use these tools to our advantage in an effective and efficient manner. It also shed light on some truly useful tools such as -

Jitter - For creating interactive content and motion design.
Super.So - Helps us convert Notion pages into websites.
Plotrchart - For creating quick charts
Descript - To streamline the creation of transcripts and video editing.

I'd like to express my gratitude to @Radhika Chopra for this insightful session and @Linux World for providing valuable opportunities to upgrade our skillset.`,
